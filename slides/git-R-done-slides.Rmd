# Outline

## We'll cover four main areas:

- Basic Workflow
- Repositories 
- Undo
- Working With Branches

# Basic Workflow

## What Is A Version Control System (VCS)?
- Tool that manages changes made to files and directories in a project
- Git is a Distributed VCS
- Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost
- Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's
  - Harder to accidentally overwrite someone else's work
- Git provides the ability to synchronize work done by different people on different PCs

## Where Does Git Store Information?
- A Git Project has two parts:
    - Files and directories you create and edit directly
    - The extra info that Git records about the project history
- Combined, these two parts make up a __repository__ (repo)
- Git stores its info in the `.git` directory at the root directory of project
- NEVER EDIT OR DELETE THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS CONTENTS!

## Issuing Git Commands

- Easiest: Use Terminal pane in RStudio
  - Configurable in RStudio to use:
    - Git Bash (installed with Git)
    - Command Prompt (Windows)
    - Windows PowerShell (Windows)
    - bash, zsh, etc. (Mac/Unix/Linux)
  - Tools/Global Options/Terminal
- All commands issued to Git wil start with `git`

## Checking The State of a Git Repo
- `git status`
  - Displays list of files that have been modified since the last changes were made
